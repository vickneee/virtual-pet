# Virtual Pet

Virtual Pet is an application where the user walks a virtual pet. The pet is represented by an icon that moves around the canvas. Whenever the user moves the mouse over the canvas, the pet starts moving towards the mouse cursor. Once the pet has reached the mouse cursor, it stops moving. The pet also stops moving if the user moves the mouse cursor outside the canvas.
